# 🏏 Score247

**Score247** is a lightweight, offline-first cricket scoring application built *for gully cricket*.

Not stadium cricket.
Not ICC-perfect rules.
Just real street matches — custom overs, flexible rules, heated moments, and memories that last longer than the score itself.

Score247 exists because **no existing app truly understands how gully cricket works**.

## 🌍 Why Score247?

Most cricket scoring apps assume:

* Fixed overs
* Fixed players
* Official rules
* Proper umpires

Gully cricket assumes:

* “2 overs each”
* “Last batsman akela khelega”
* “Wide pe run hai ya nahi?”
* “No ball dobara hogi ya nahi?”

Score247 lets **players define the rules before the match starts** — so there are no fights *during* the match.

❤️ Final Note

Score247 isn’t just an app.

It’s that dusty pitch.
That taped tennis ball.
That one match everyone still argues about.

Built for the streets.
Built with heart.
