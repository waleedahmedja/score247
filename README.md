# score247
Score247 is a lightweight, offline-first cricket scoring app.  Not professional stadiums. Not ICC rulebooks. Just raw cricket — taped tennis balls, uneven overs, arguments over no-balls, and that one guy who always says the toss was unfair.  Score247 exists because nothing out there truly understands street cricket.
